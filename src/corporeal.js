/*
Corporeal is a library for generating fun test data for Hyperlink components

It draws on source data from Darius Kazemi's 'Corpora' project:
https://github.com/dariusk/corpora
> a collection of static corpora that are potentially useful in the creation of weird internet stuff
…hence the name of this lib :D

PLEASE NOTE…
- For ease of use, below functions take no parameters
- Some have variants e.g. getRandomTitleBook() and getRandomTitleBookShort()
- Tweak and add additional variants as needed!

Things it can generate:
- Titles: for cards
	- getRandomTitleBook()
	- getRandomTitleBookShort()
	- getRandomTitleWeird()
	- getRandomTitleOccupation()
- Content: text content, also for cards; one paragraph or several
	- getRandomParagraph()
	- getRandomContent()
- Names: human names e.g. Albert Einstein
	- getRandomName()
- Usernames: strings e.g. YachtJuan367
	- getRandomUsername()

Maybe later:
- Section names
- Chat content e.g. messages
- Bot and Member card data
