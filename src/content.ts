Welcome to Hyperlink! This card will:

1) Show you how Hyperlink works
2) Help you get started making Spaces
3) Inspire you to try some fun experiments!

==For more info, click "i" in the sidebar==

# How Hyperlink Works

The very basics: make cards; organize them in rooms; talk about them together!

**Quick things to try:**

- make a room from the sidebar
- make a card (double click the canvas)
- add card content — image, linked cards, date, reactions — from the toolbar up top
- add a comment at the bottom of a card

**When you invite others, you'll also find:**

- audio calls, to hang & explore stuff together
- live presence, to see where others are
- unreads, to see what's new in the space
- notifications, for alerts on new activity

👯 You can invite collaborators at any time! But if you'd like to test things out first, we're glad to help with some feedback & experimentation.

🚨 Send us the invite link from the sidebar to contact@hyperlink.academy & one of us will join (you can delete the Space after testing!)

# Making Spaces

Quick checklist for setting up a Space:

1️⃣ **set a goal** — what are you aiming to do? what's the ideal outcome? how should it end?

2️⃣ **add things to explore** (readings? questions?) and make cards for each

3️⃣ **organize things** in rooms, e.g. canvas for ideas, collection for tasks, chat for…chat!

4️⃣ **decide what to do** e.g. weekly calls; sharing things and commenting on them

5️⃣ **invite a friend** (or a few) to join!

# Things to Try

Space are super flexible…you can design many *games* with these basic pieces:

- **reading club**: add readings & discuss
- **writing group**: share drafts and feedback
- **creative projects**: manage tasks; make things; share work in progress
- **prompts**: e.g. each share a daily drawing
- **interactive workshops** or other sessions
